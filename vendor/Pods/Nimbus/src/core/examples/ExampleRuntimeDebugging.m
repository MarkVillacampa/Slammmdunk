/**
 * @example ExampleRuntimeDebugging.m
 *
 * Modifying class methods at runtime can be a very powerful debugging tool. Consider the
 * following example:
 *
 * You are finding that you have a memory leak with one of your view controllers, but you're
 * not sure where the extra retain is being made. If you swap the retain implementation on
 * UIViewController with your own method then you can set a breakpoint in the method and look
 * at the stack each time retain is called. This method is similar to setting a breakpoint
 * in GDB on the UIViewController's retain method but allows programmatic control over when you
 * want to hit the breakpoint.
 *
 * This example is part of @link Runtime-Class-Modifications Runtime Class Modifications@endlink.
